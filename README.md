# Adventure_Board
This is the final and biggest project for the course "Programming with Python"

As the title indicates this project represents a board game with an adventurous
nature. Actual game is played with the computer mouse and  has a GUI. It draws
the board and all objects on it. The player must enter a name and choose a hero
according to his preferences. The board has obstacles on it so the hero won't 
be able to move everywhere. There are places where the only way to a new area 
is through a door.

A fundamental game characteristic is that the 
moves and the gameflow will be defined by throwing a dices with total between 
0 and 10. The hero has an inventory for the items which he collects from 
the map. He is destined to fight sentinels which live on the board. They have 
different difficulty and will try their best to destroy him. They also protect
various of items, doors, treasures and other helpful things for the player. 
The sentinels will be static on the board game.

The hero has his set of basic and special skills. Every hero implements the 
basic skills such as: hit(), use(item), level_up() and so on...
However there are special skills defined for only certain types of heroes.
When a hero reaches next level, the player must choose which one of the 
special skills to learn depending on his game style and strategy. The basic 
skills don't require any resource of the player. On the other hand the special
ones require something that the player must sacrifice. 

Gaining experience is the way for the hero to reach higher level. That has an 
impact on his characteristics(health, attack, armor and so on). Heroes gain 
experience from killing sentinels and completing quests.

The sentinels are not the only other units on the board. There are nautrals 
with witch the hero can interact. Salesman, craftsman, gamblers and others 
can make the game a bit more interesting. 

There are places in the game where the hero can regenerate or do 

The final goal is to kill a very powerfull boss who disturbs the board world. 
Becoming powerful enough himself, the player will bring peace in the game.
